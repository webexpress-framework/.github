## Privacy at a Glance

Due to its nature as a framework, **WebExpress** neither collects nor stores any personal data on its own. It provides the technical foundation for building web applications, but does not implement data handling or persistence by default. Any collection, processing, or storage of data is solely determined by the implementing application and its configuration.

However, when interacting with the **WebExpress-Framework** GitHub organization, certain data—such as your GitHub username, contributions, and activity logs—may be processed and stored by GitHub Inc.. No additional personal data is collected beyond what GitHub provides as part of its platform usage. For details, refer to [GitHub’s Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).
